My 2D game project TRON GAME.

I developed the back-end part.

There are 3 maps and 2 vehicles and also databases.

There is a pause menu , how_to_play screen , nickname entering screen and timer.

This is 2 players game. I used pygame and Turtle libraries.

I used MySQL for databases.

There are 4 power-ups and every player has 3 healths.

You can run the game from "Tron.py" file.
